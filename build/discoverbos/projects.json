We believe in NFTs with practical applications and use cases: membership access, ticketing, communal projects, redeemable NFTs and so much more.\\n\\nFor us, NFTs represent the grounds for a new financial system. By providing verifiable digital ownership, the possibilities created are endless: they’re scarce, interoperable and cryptographically secure. With our split royalties and revenue features, collaborative projects have a whole other way to deal with their finances. \\n\\nAt Mintbase, everyone gets their own smart contract and can add several minters to their store. Think “Shopify for NFTs”: People can create their stores to sell music, art, tickets, memberships and much more. In a nutshell, anything can be tokenized. The Mintbase interface can easily be used, but via our SDK anyone can spin off their own NFT marketplaces.",

By leveraging the Points System, Popula’s Community Economy Protocol Set helps creators monetise and incentivise member co-creation. They enable creators to leverage expertise from within their communities, freeing up their time while generating increasingly higher-quality content and accelerating growth. At the same time, members of those communities can see their contribution recognized (accruing reputation) and rewarded (accruing upside and perks), which encourages them to keep supporting more creators, thus fueling the whole ecosystem’s growth.",
